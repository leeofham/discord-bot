To do:

Some sort repeated event,
  check current time in milliseconds compared to time of event + 2 hours in milliseconds
  if greater current time is greater, delete all messages from channel
  (maybe delete old event from database)
  do axios request check if its a repeated event
  if it is make new event for week later using moments

Reminder messages

Some sort of loop for tanks, healers and dds in embedded messages



Refactoring:

Sort something out so that you can use embedded message in numerous files/folders
